Hints (added 20240919|Thomas Völker):
* directory permissions are checked to be 0750, apart from directory group/owner
* PHP version check extended to include PHP 8.3
* DB user is required to have full privileges on mySQL (select from mysql.user). Using a distinct user and assigning privileges did not work. Using root worked.
* DB must not exist
